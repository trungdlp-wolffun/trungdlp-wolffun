## About Me

I'm a backend developer at Wolffun Game, where I work on building scalable and efficient systems to power our online games. I have a strong background in software development, with experience in programming languages such as Go, Java, and JS.

## What I'm Working On

Currently, I'm working on building a real-time game server using Golang and Redis to handle the game state and player interactions. I'm also collaborating with the front-end team to integrate the server with the game client using Socket.

## What I'm Learning

I'm always looking to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies in the industry. Currently, I'm learning about distributed systems and microservices architecture to help us scale our game servers as we grow.
